Titanium Facebook Module for Android
=====================================

Overview
------------
* Please read thie carefully since this module is (by necessity) different from previous Facebook Android modules
* This module is based on Facebook's latest Android SDK (3.18.0, currently), and in accordance with Facebook's samples and recommendations.
* The API is similar to the iOS Facebook module I wrote, differing in some places where required.
* The module uses the Facebook SDK with no modifications
* AppEvents: activateApp can monitor app installs and usage patterns. All you need to do is create a proxy for each activity in your app, and view the data on Facebook Insights. Additionally we can log custom events.

Current Functionality
---------------------
* Login/logout (Read Facebook docs for changes in this space)
* Additional permissions requests
* Graph API (version 2.1, read Facebook's docs for the changes, in particular regarding the user_friends permission).
* Share dialog
* Like button
* Additional functionality will be implemented over time, pull requests greatly appreciated

Installation Details
--------------------
* The minimum required SDK version is 3.5.0 (lifecycleContainer merged October 24th)
* If you want to use the production 3_4_X branch, you may use this, which is kept current with Appcelerator's 3_4_X: https://github.com/mokesmokes/titanium_mobile/tree/3_4_M
* In tiapp.xml or AndroidManifest.xml you must declare the following inside the `<application>` node
`<activity android:name="com.facebook.LoginActivity" android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar" 
	android:label="YourAppName"/>`
* You must also reference the string containing your Facebook app ID, inside the `<application>` node as well: 
`<meta-data android:name="com.facebook.sdk.ApplicationId" android:value="@string/app_id"/>`
* The app id goes into the the file `/platform/android/res/values/strings.xml`, where you should define
`<resources><string name="app_id">1234567890123456</string></resources>`, where the number is of course the app ID. The app ID is not set programmatically.

Module Versioning
-----------------

x.y.zt, where x.y.z is the Facebook iOS SDK version, t denotes the Titanium module version for this SDK.
For example, module version 3.18.01 uses Facebook Android SDK 3.18.0

Proxy required per Android activity
-----------------------------------
Unlike iOS, where the entire app is active in memory, in Android only a single Activity is active at any time. An Activity corresponds to a Ti.UI.Window or Ti.UI.TabGroup. The Facebook SDK contains tools to synchronize state between the various activities in the app, and this module implements that functionality, but for this to work we need to tell the module which is the currently active Activity. Thus the following is required:
* All Windows/TabGroup that require Facebook functionality must create a proxy: `var fb = fbModule.createActivityWorker({lifecycleContainer: aWindowOrTabGroup});`
* We must pass to the proxy the Ti.UI.Window or Ti.UI.TabGroup that will be using the proxy, so that the proxy can attach itself to the window's or tabgroup's activity.
* The proxy object must be created prior to calling open() on the window or tabgroup in order to make sure the Activity onCreate event is captured correctly.
* **The entire Facebook module API**, including methods, properties, and events **occurs on the proxy object** and not on the module object.

Module API
----------

* Require the module: `var fbModule = require('com.ti.facebook');`
* Create a proxy for each Activity (Window or TabGroup) that needs Facebook functionality: `var fb = fbModule.createActivityWorker({lifecycleContainer: win);`
* The permissions array may be set by calling `setPermissions(['public_profile', 'email', etc])` on the proxy object, or in the proxy creation dictionary `var fb = fbModule.createActivityWorker({permissions: [.....]});`, or passed to the `initialize` function detailed below. Note that these are just the requested read permissions, and not necessarily the permissions granted to the app. These permissions will only be used when initially authenticating with Facebook. You need to set the permissions only once, for the initial proxy used in the app.
* The actual permissions granted to the app may be read at any time by checking `var permissions = fb.permissions;` 
* Add login and logout event listeners on the proxy object. The syntax and functionality is identical to the current Titanium Facebook module.
* After setting up the login and logout listeners, call `fb.initialize([optional timeout]);`. If there is a cached Facebook session available, the login event will be fired immediately. `initialize` should only be called once, for the initial proxy in the app.
* `fb.requestNewReadPermissions([new read permissions], function(e) {....});` The callback will indicate `success`, `error` or `cancelled`. If `success`, then you need to get `fb.permissions` to check the actually active permissions on the session.
* `requestNewPublishPermissions` - same as for requestNewReadPermissions. Note these functions take on added importance since users can decline individual permissions when initially logging in, except for `public_profile` which is mandatory.
* `fb.requestWithGraphPath` - same as in Appcelerator's Titanium module.
* `fb.authorize()` should be called to initiate the login process if the user is logged out and the user clicks on the login button
* Share Dialog: see below.

Events and error handling
-------------------------

The `login` event behavior is normalized to behave similarly to iOS. If you're logged in after initialization,
you *will* get a `login` event. It's important to understand the reason for this: The module checks the SDK for a cached token.
However, there is a possibility this token is invalid without the SDK's knowledge (e.g. the user changed her password, etc).
Thus, the only way to verify the token's and session's validity is to make a call to Facebook's servers. 
You will not get the `login` event if there was no cached session. 
In that case - the module will close the session. Below is the integrated flow for both Android and iOS:
```javascript
var fbModule = require('com.ti.facebook');
var fb = fbModule.createActivityWorker({lifecycleContainer: win1});
fb.permissions = ['public_profile', 'email', 'user_friends'];
// now set up listeners
fb.addEventListener('login', function(e) {
	if(e.success) {
		// do your thang.... 
	} else if (e.cancelled) {
		// login was cancelled, just show your login UI again
	} else if (e.error) {
		if (Ti.Platform.name === 'iPhone OS') {
			var loginAlert = Ti.UI.createAlertDialog({title: 'Login Error'});
			if (e.error.indexOf('OTHER:') !== 0){
				// guaranteed a string suitable for display to user
				loginAlert.message = e.error;
			} else {
				//alert('Please check your network connection and try again.');
				// after "OTHER:" there may be useful error data, not suitable for user display
				loginAlert.message = 'Please check your network connection and try again';
			}
		} else {
			loginAlert.message = e.error;
		}
	} else {
		// if not success, nor cancelled, nor error message then pop a generic message
		// e.g. "Check your network, etc" . This is per Facebook's instructions
	}
});

fb.addEventListener('logout', function(e)........
		
fb.initialize(5000); // the module will do nothing prior to this. This enabled you to set up listeners anywhere in the app	
                     // You can (and should) pass a timeout (in ms) for the /me request that occurs upon login,
                     // the default value is 0 (no timeout)

if (!fb.loggedIn) {
	// you want to show your login UI in this case
	// if the user is loggedIn, just wait for the login event
	// when you want the user to login, call fb.authorize()
}

myLoginButton.addEventListener('click', function(e) {
	fb.authorize(); // this will show the Facebook login UI
	.....
});
```

Refreshing Permissions
----------------------

Facebook now grants total control over granted permissions, and if the user modified the permissions
outside of your app your cached token may not be updated. To get the current permissions from
Facebook's servers you can call `fb.refreshPermissionsFromServer()`. You may listen for the `tokenUpdated`
event to be notified of this operation's successful completion.

Share Dialog
-------------

See the [Facebook docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android/share-dialog/)
Use it! You don't need permissions, you don't even need the user to be logged into your app with Facebook!
*	First check if you can use it - check the properties `fb.canPresentShareDialog` or `fb.canPresentOpenGraphActionDialog`, depending upon your desired sharing action.
Unfortunately this is less concise than the iOS module, due to the SDK.
*	To share a user's status just call `fb.share({});` Note: this is documented for iOS but not Android, so use with caution.
*	To share a link call `fb.share({url: 'http://example.com' });`
*	To post a graph action call:

```javascript
fb.share({url: someUrl, namespaceObject: 'myAppnameSpace:graphObject', objectName: 'graphObject', imageUrl: someImageUrl, 
		title: aTitle, description: blahBlah, namespaceAction: 'myAppnameSpace:actionType', placeId: facebookPlaceId}`
```
For the graph action apparently only placeId is optional.

Like Button
-----------

We can create a Like button just like any other view, with specific parameters documented in Facebook docs. Note there is no completion callback or event, and Facebook policies state "If you use the Like button on iOS or Android, donâ€™t collect or use any information from it."
 
```
var likeButton = fbModule.createLikeButton({
	top: 10,
	height: Ti.UI.SIZE,
	width: Ti.UI.SIZE, // just like any other view
	objectId: "https://www.facebook.com/NYKnicks", // URL or Facebook ID
	foregroundColor: "white", // A color in Titanium format - see Facebook docs
	likeViewStyle: 'box_count', // standard, button, box_count - see FB docs
	auxiliaryViewPosition: 'inline', // bottom, inline, top - see FB docs
	horizontalAlignment: 'left' // center, left, right - see FB docs
});
someView.add(likeButton);
```

Custom App Events
-----------------
```
fbActivityWorker.logCustomEvent('handsClapped'); // Pass a string for the event name, view the events on Facebook Insights
```
